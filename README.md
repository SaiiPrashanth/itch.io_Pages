## Script Reference

### Description Files (`*_description.html`)
Raw HTML snippets designed to be pasted into the "Description" field of an itch.io project page. They provide structured layouts (images, feature lists, links) that bypass standard text editor limitations.

### Theme Files (`*_theme.css`)
Custom CSS files used to override the default itch.io page styling. They control:
- **Colors**: Backgrounds, text, and accent colors to match the game's branding.
- **Fonts**: Custom font families and sizes.
